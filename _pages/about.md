Hi, I'm Charles Yang! Welcome to my little island floating out in the vast internet! I'm a youth minister at [Grace Chinese Baptist Church of Richmond (GCBCR) ](http://www.gcbcr.org/) and a Masters of Theological Studies seminary student at [Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary](https://www.gordonconwell.edu/).

In my free time, I'm currently an ARPA-E Tech-to-Market Summer Fellow and starting as a Software Engineer on the ML team at [SambaNova Systems](https://sambanova.ai/) in Fall 2021. I just finished my [5th year masters at UC Berkeley in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/industry-programs/5yrms), focusing on robust and secure AI. You can find [my thesis on defenses for AI security here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2021/EECS-2021-90.html). 

I recently published two policy papers: one with [CSET@Georgetown on AI for science](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/machine-intelligence-for-scientific-discovery-and-engineering-invention/) and another with [DayOneProject on how to decarbonize the power grid](https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/building-back-with-a-cleaner-power-grid-for-america). 

I'm also a part of the [Interact_ community](https://joininteract.com/)!


>    Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him,
    and He will make straight your paths. Be not wise in your own eyes;
    fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.
