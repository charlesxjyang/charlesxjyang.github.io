Hi, I'm Charles Yang! Welcome to my little island floating out in the vast internet!

In my free time, Iâ€™m a [5th year masters student at UC Berkeley in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/industry-programs/5yrms), focusing on robust and secure AI. I'm co-advised by [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) and [Joey Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/). More broadly, I'm interested in applying machine learning and deep learning to various scientific applications. I'm currently interning at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) and conducting research with [Grace Gu in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Berkeley](https://gu.berkeley.edu/)
Recently, I started a newsletter focusing on applications of machine learning to various scientific fields called [ML4Sci](https://ml4sci.substack.com/)

>    Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him,
    and He will make straight your paths. Be not wise in your own eyes;
    fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.
