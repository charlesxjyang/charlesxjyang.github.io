From the abstract: The optimization of the size and location of Photovoltaic (PV) Distributed Generation (DG) is a method for reducing distribution networks loss, cutting costs for utilities, and integrating renewable energy into the power grid. However, this optimization problem is a difficult mixed continuous discrete problem that is difficult to solve efficiently. Herein, we propose a novel Sequential PVDG Placement algorithm which utilizes a Downstream Power Index (DPI) for PV allocation. We compare Sequential PVDG Placement results with those of Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA), a memetic heuristic algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates similar accuracy and drastically less computation time compared to SFLA. Given its high accuracy and low computation time, sequential PVDG allocation algorithm may be useful for rapid online power dispatch, long-term planning, and microgrid operations under high penetration of renewable sources.
